== Deployment

1. Create a checklist YAML file or use one in the `checklists`
directory
2. Copy all files in the `src` directory to a directory (letâ€™s call it
the HTTP directory).
3. Copy the checklist YAML file that you want to use to the HTTP
directory, and rename the YAML file to `checklist.yaml`.
4. Serve all files in the HTTP directory as static files.
